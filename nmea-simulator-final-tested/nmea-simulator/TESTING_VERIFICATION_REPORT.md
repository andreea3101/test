## 🔧 **Issues Found and Fixed**

### **Issue 1: Simple Working Simulator GPS Generation**
- **Problem**: Generated "GGASentence()" instead of NMEA strings
- **Root Cause**: Using str() on sentence objects
- **Fix**: Updated to use SentenceBuilder for proper NMEA generation
- **Verification**: Now generates perfect NMEA sentences like `$GPGGA,044546.187,3748.0431,N,12224.0431,W,1,08,1.2,0.0,M,19.6,M,,*4D`

### **Issue 2: Newline Character Problems**
- **Problem**: Literal "\\n" in output instead of actual newlines
- **Root Cause**: String escaping issues in file writes
- **Fix**: Replaced all \\\\n with \\n throughout the codebase
- **Verification**: Clean file output with proper line breaks
